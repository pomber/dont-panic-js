>~~Space~~ JavaScript is big. Really Big, You just won't believe how vastly hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to ~~space~~ JavaScript.   

... but JavaScript is mostly harmless, and here are 42 resources to keep you from panicking:
